I was born Bernard Allen Falkman, in Oak Park hospital.... my total hospital bill&nbsp; was $34.95 for a 5 day stay. (I still have the receipt) at that time my Mom was living with my fathers mother at Long and Augusta (Austin Area, in the city.) The war was still going on and father was overseas. Mom was in Casablanca when she found out that she was pregnant... and she was shipped back stateside. </span></p><br /><p><span>My father had met my Mom when he was stationed at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. He was a First Ltd. and Mom was a Second Ltd. (she was an army nurse and out ranked him) </span></p><br /><p><span>At the end of the war father returned home with a promise of a job in Calif. So we took the train to San Mateo... Two day ride on the train... While out there, father worked as a chemist for the American Can Company.&nbsp; We stayed in Calif. for 2 years and there my brothers Jerry and Richard were born.</span></p><p><span>A few thing that I can remember from San Mateo are that one day I decided to grab my moms sewing tin (old cookie tin) Dump out the contents and went looking for worms. Just a block away and you were at the foot of the mountains.... Anyway, I went digging for worms... and found a whole bunch of them... But them in the empty sewing tin. And brought them back to show mom.... When she opened the tin, she screamed and dropped the tin.... Apparently I hadn&#39;t gathered up worms... but baby rattle snakes.... She beat them to death right there on the kitchen floor... Must have been about a half-dozen of them.... So much for my worm hunting.... </span></p><br /><p><span>Another time I can remember is that we had a white picket fence around the yard... and daredevil me would climb up and stand on the top horizontal rail... One evening as dad pulled into the drive way while I was on top of the fence... Suddenly I slipped and was caught around the neck between two of the pickets... Not tall enough, I couldn&#39;t get out of this. I almost hung myself... Thank God dad was there and pulled me off the fence or that would have been the end of me... So much for my fence climbing.... </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember that father had a friend and he flew airplanes. One weekend he took Mom and me up for a flight. Everything was great until Mom got a little scared and then I threw up all over the cockpit....&nbsp; So much for plane rides. </span></p><br /><p><span>About the only other thing that I remember (and this is something I was told) was that right across the street there lived a gangster.... And one evening the local police surrounded the place with squads and were ready to do battle if the guy didn&#39;t come out peaceful.... But I didn&#39;t witness it... I was told years later...</span></p><p><span>After the two boys were born. It was off back to Chicago.... We stayed for a short while on Long and Augusta, this was my father&#39;s parents home. And then we moved to 19th Ave. in Maywood. We rented an old two story frame house from someone my father knew at work. I can remember we took in a border. His name was Clem, can&#39;t remember his last name. We had a fire place in the living room and I can remember on Saturday nights we would all gather round and pop, popcorn. I can also recall that our mom was working at Westlake Hospital at the time. And when it came time for us to have our flu shots. She would line us boys up on the edge of the bed. Butts in the air, and go right down the line, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch. </span></p><br /><p><span>A couple more things I can remember, was that one Christmas we got a blackboard from &#39;Santa&#39; And a friend of father&#39;s (Mike Murphy) had used chalk to draw a picture of Santa. Coming down the stairs that morning, I saw the picture in the dimly lit living room. And it scared the crap out of me... Wouldn&#39;t come down until mom assured me that everything was OK... </span></p><br /><p><span>Last but not least I can remember father taking 8mm motion pictures of us. One was titled &quot;How to make babies&quot;. He had a big cardboard box on the kitchen table. And would reach inside and pull out one of the boys... I was first. Then he would stop the camera, put Jerry in the box and start the camera again. And pull out Jerry. Then repeat the procedure for Dick... </span></p><br /><p><span>The next movie was &quot;How to Grow Baby&quot;. This time he laid the box on its side, Put me in on one end of the box and Jerry in at the other end. Then dad and Clem would start pulling each end. Me by the shoulders and Jerry by the feet. Kind of like stretching one boy out. </span></p><br /><p><span>This was the first year I attended school. It was kindergarten and the school was Irving Middle School.. And then it was out to Lombard. We lived on Ethel about 2 blocks off of main. We were the only house for 2 square blocks... </span></p><br /><p><span>By now Mom was pregnant with Robert. I can remember going to Sacred Heart Catholic school... And we raised chickens... from eggs.. Watched them hatch and grow... and from those chickens, more eggs. I can remember going out to the hen house on a cold winters day to fetch eggs... In my barefoot. And once in the chicken coop the chicken shit oozing up between my toes.... Yuck...... Also, on Sundays, once the chickens were too old to lay eggs. Father would grab a couple of them and wacky, off with there heads... they would run around the back yard for 20 - 30 seconds before falling over dead. Then Mom would dunk them in a pail of boiling water to remove the feathers.... She would then clean them up and fry them.... Mmmmm Good eatin&#39;.</span></p><br /><p><span>I can also remember my mother learning to drive a car while we lived there... Nothing but empty corn fields around us for 2 square blocks.... </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember my brother Richard falling and almost cutting off two if his fingers... He had fallen on a cycle... and rushing him to the hospital to sew them back on.... Thank God he didn&#39;t lose them. </span></p><br /><p><span>I can remember that we had a black cocker spaniel. Called her &#39;Bonnie Dog&#39;.... And one spring morning she disappeared.... Under the porch to deliver 6 of the prettiest puppies you could ever have seen. We only stayed for about a year, year and a-half.(owner died and his family wanted to sell the place). </span></p><br /><p><span>I do remember the winter we spent in Lombard. I had gotten a sled for Christmas. I wanted to take it out and try it out... Mom bundled me up so I would be nice and worm and off I went with my new sled... Down at the end of the road there was a cross street (Finley), had a nice slope to it. You could go for about 100 yards before you would stop. I remember sliding down the road and putting my tongue on the bare metal of the sled. Well, everyone knows what happens when you put something wet on to frozen metal. There I was laying in the middle of the street, on my sled, with my tongue stuck permanently to the sled. Now I started to panic, what if a car came down the road? That would have been the end of me... So I tried to roll off the road, but the sled was too wide for me to get it to roll. So here I am stuck in the middle of this road, praying that a car doesn&#39;t come running along... But anyway, I somehow got my tongue off the sled and headed home. Needless to say I never put my tongue on that sled again. </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember, that mom and dad would sit in the living room and listen to the radio after dinner. And one evening dad hooked up the radio to a microphone up in our bedroom... So when they sat down and started listening to the radio the three of us started singing on the radio... Surprised mom... I think it was her birthday and we sang &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; over the radio to her... </span></p><p><span>From Lombard we moved back to the city... Way up north on Touhy. It was a housing project for returning service man. I started 1st grade at St. Julianas... (This was a housing project for returning service personal and their families.... ) I must have been 7 at the time. The only recollection I have of Touhy is that we had brought Bonnie Dog with us... But she couldn&#39;t get use to the streets or the traffic... almost got run over several times... So we had to get give her up.... </span></p><br /><p><span>Also, had chicken pocks at this time. along with my&nbsp; brothers (now 4) We didn&#39;t stay long on Touhy... About 6 months. And then we moved to another housing project on Foster and Killborn. (now it&#39;s a forest preserve meadow) School this time was St. Cornelius</span></p><p><span>I can remember taking the bus to school along with 2 of my brothers.(school was about 2 miles away)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the summer we would take our bus money and buy candy... and then walk home... Things that I can remember about living on Foster are the Schwinn bike I got from my grand-father. It was an old second hand Schwinn. Herman had cleaned it up and repainted it like new. Boy, I was free, road that bike all over. To the park, the store, all over the&nbsp; housing project. </span></p><br /><p><span>Miss Slattery was my third grade teacher. Mean as all get-out. I think she was the only lay teacher at St. Cornelius. I was left handed and she would make me wear this thick wool mitten on my left hand so I would have to use my right hand to write with... Didn&#39;t work... I would sneak the glove off and write lefty.... </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember an incident where all the boys were standing in line for a turn in the washroom... and everyone is pushing and shoving... Well the kid in front of me slips... I think the floor was wet... But anyway... the nuns grabbed me and said I pushed him (he had split his head open and had to be taken to the hospital). I said no I had not pushed him.. and was crying... But they insisted I did and I was sent home to tell my mother... I got home and I was so scared that I went right to bed.. and didn&#39;t say a word. The nuns later found out that the floor was wet and the kid did slip. When my Mom found out about the incident she went to school and really gave them hell.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I can remember walking home on summer days... Me and my brothers would go by a glass factory ... and they would dump all the broken glass out along the railroad tracks.... The company made stain glass windows ... and we would pick up all different colors of glass... Red&#39;s, purples, greens blues, yellows, black, and white, and just about any color in between...&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>I can remember the swimming pool 2 blocks away and the playground... I can remember going to the store for my Mom... She wanted a gal. of milk... Gave me a $5 bill... Half way to the store, I lose the money... Boy was I in deep shit.... I had to go back and tell her. </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember the 4 of us boys sleeping in one bed. (double bed) One night my brother Jerry and I slept with our heads together (touching) And when we woke up in the morning we had both dreamed the same dream... I would say I saw this in my dream and he would pick up were I left off.... Amazing... And the whole dream was about this new place and new school.... </span></p><br /><p><span>We stayed on Foster for three years. and then moved to Kedzie and Belmont. This is St. Veronica&#39;s parish... The first week that we (bros. &amp; I) went to school. My brother Jerry and I recognized the route that we were taking to school... It was all in our dream months earlier... The candy store. the street and intersections... the way to school... Wow..... This is my recollection of 4th grade.. I can remember the Fridays during lent... We would go to communion and then we would have milk and doughnuts... That was great... I can remember helping the janitor go around and clean the floors... When it came to the girls washroom... he would swear and say that the girls restrooms were 3 times dirtier than the boys washrooms.. I can also remember helping the nuns at the Convent. It made me feel good and I&#39;m sure I was praised for it.... </span></p><br /><p><span>Another thing that I remember is that we moved once, two blocks away... Stayed in the same parish.... Now we were living on Whipple.. Just off Belmont. At this location I can remember seeing my first TV. The father of the family down stairs worked for some electronics company... (Maybe Motorola or something like that.) Anyway it was a round TV tube and we would go down stairs and watch Howdy Doody and some other comedy programs. I can remember a school friend of mine having a race with my brother Jerry, who could climb a tree the fastest. There were several Sycamores across the street... My friend climbed to the very top.... But before he could start down, he slipped and fell 2 stories... injured his back... the ambulance came and took him away.... </span></p><br /><p><span>We stayed a year all together. And then moved to Maywood... 1829 S. 20th Ave.</span></p><p><span>In Maywood, I attended Roosevelt Elementary School. Down on 15th and Lexington. We lived on 20th and Lexington. So it wasn&#39;t such a long distance to go. Started 5th grade there... Teachers name was Miss Babcock. Don&#39;t remember 6th grade or the teacher... Seventh grade I had Mr. Robinson. and in eighth grade I had... hmmm can&#39;t remember just now. Just remembered, it was Mrs. Hunter.</span></p></div>
