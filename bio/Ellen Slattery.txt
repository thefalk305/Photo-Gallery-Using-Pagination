History of Ellen Slattery


	Ellen Slattery was born sometime in 1833, in Ireland.  Her and her mother migrated to America sometime in the 1840's.  She married Dennis Allen on the 10th  of August 1851.  Ellen had a total of four children. Two of whom died either at child birth or at a very young age. Their first child was born on the 7th of July 1852, named Gerauld Allen.  Their second son, William was born on the 9th of December 1859. It would be logical that the other two children were born between 1852 and 1859. There being a 7 year gap.

     
	The 1860 census has Ellen listed with her husband Dennis and their two children, Gerauld and William. The address that is listed in the census is on Rensselaer St. At this time Ellen is listed to be 26  yrs. old. This is probably the most correct date of her birth.
	
	Dennis died on the 9th of July 1862.  Ellen was 29 at the time, Gerold was 10, and William would have been about 2 1/2 yrs. old.  At this time she was living at 89 Franklin St. in Albany, N.Y. I think she had moved in to live with her mother. On the 6th of March 1868 Ellen applied for a transfer of pension to the Chicago Illinois office.  Where she would travel to and live with relatives, at 243 E. Madison St.
     
	By the 1870 census Ellen had established a boarding house and was residing at 285 S. Clinton.  Along with her are her two sons, Gerold & William.
     
	The 1880 census has Ellen living at 556 Lafflin (the S.E. corner of west 18th St.  Ellen is listed as being 44 yrs. old and living with her is one son (William).  Gerold would have been 27 yrs. old and presumably married at the time.
     Ellen died on Sunday the 3rd of June, 1883. I wonder if she didn't die of a broken heart. What with her son passing away so recently
