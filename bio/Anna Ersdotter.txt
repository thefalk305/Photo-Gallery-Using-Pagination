I don't have very many facts about Pehr's first wife. They were married 22 May 1835. She was from Arbr√§, Sweden. And came from a farm called Forneby. She died in November the following year, about 18 months after being married. She could have died from Influenza, or maybe pneumonia, or even child birth. At this time I don't know.
