It was told to me that Löfgren was John's wife's maiden name. And that this is the name he took when he married her. Late note... Just found wife's rightful name to be Olsdotter.... So that shoots the madden name in the foot... BUT... Inger (wife) was born in Löfvestad... So I'm thinking that Löfgren was taken not from her last name, but from the town that she came from... OK!

I called one of John's grandchildren. A son of Jennie Sturm, Richard, He informed me that the family story was that John Löfgren became homesick for Sweden. And that John had booked passage back to Sweden and that he had died on the boat to Sweden. 

It seems that John may have used the name John Johnson while he was living in America...
