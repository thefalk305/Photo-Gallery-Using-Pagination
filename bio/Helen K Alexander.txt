<div><p><span>Helen K. Alexander</span><span>&nbsp;My mom was born on the 3rd of March, 1921. In Hackettstown, New Jersey. She was the youngest of three (3) children. Unfortunately she didn&#39;t speak much of her childhood. And I haven&#39;t been able to find out much about her as she was growing up. </span><span>FLASH... Helen K. Alexander baptized, 13 Mar. 1921</span><span>&nbsp;I do know that she met my dad at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, during the war. And there they had a whirlwind romance and were married at one of the chapels in Camp Kilmer.</span></p></div>
