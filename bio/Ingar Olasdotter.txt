Englie... Or Ingrad Löfgren (I think this is her proper name) emigrated to the United States in 1887. She brought with her two (2) children. Clara, & Emma. In the 1900 US Census she is listed as 'Head' of the house. No husband is listed, but she says she is married. Also living with the family are two borders. John Johnson, and a William Beckland. Both from Sweden.

The 1900 Census has the family listed incorrectly. Listing them as 'Lovgreen' When actually the name is spelled 'Löfgren'. Later census correct the miss spelling. But by then the family is split up (i.e. married, or off on their own.)

Altho Ingrad was born in Lovstad, at the time of her wedding she was living in Hamra Sõdregråd. She is listed as a servant or madden (piga)
