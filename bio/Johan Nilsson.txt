Johan Nilsson was born on the 25th of May, 1819. In Sankt Olof, Sweden. There he lived with his parents (Nils & Hanna) and 8 siblings   His oldest brother (JÃ¶ns) was 19 years older then himself. And his oldest sister (Agda) was 21 years older then he was. Agda, was probable married and out of the house by the time he was born. Any way it looks like Johan stayed with the family until he was about 21 yrs. of age. In the 1841 house records Johan is living with a couple of friends, in Roflanda. And by later on that year he's moving to Hvitaby.


When married to Karna Persdotter Johan was residing at Gruflanda No. 18.
