Mary Alice Falkman

	 Mary was a very strong willed woman.  She loved her family very much and protected them.  She and her husband, Herman lived at 1001 N. Long.  She and Herman had two children, Beatrice and Allen. During the war (WW II) both Bea and Allen's wife lived with Mary and Herman at that address. After the war the house was sold and Mary and Herman lived at Austin & Jackson. I can remember as a small child going out with my grandfather (Herman) into the park and chasing golf balls.  From there they moved to Washington and Lockwood. Where they lived for quit a long time. After that they moved in with their daughter Bea, in Oak Park (911 Taylor).
Nani (Mary) as we called her remained a strong influence in the family for the remainder of her life. The last couple years she spent in a home, (Cortland Manor, at 1900 N. Karlov) in the city (Chicago). It is with fond memories that I remember my grandmother and all that she stood for.

	Mary attended Emmet Grade School. St. Catherine of Siena High School in Chicago and in her sophomore year she was expelled for throwing an eraser at one of the nuns. She then attended Austin High and it is reported that she was expelled from there also. The facts are unclear at this time...

	Mary and Herman were married shortly after Herman finished high school. They had secretly married out in Joliet, Illinois. But, the following week, when Mary's folks found out about the secret marriage. The were re-married a month later at the R.C. church.
