Ernest Sturm was a yard Forman for a R.R. company in New York. 
One Monday morning Ernest went to work, and never returned home. His wife Jennie called the police and searched for her husband. But never found him.
Jennie finally gave up the search for her husband and returned to DuBois PA. where she was born, and had family.
Some 35(?) yrs later, Jennies son received a phone call from a women in Texas, claiming "I think we're step-siblings. Richard Sturm, hung up the phone. This women called repeatedly, But it wasn't until a couple years later that Richard would finally receive a call from her. He was thinking, he wanted nothing to do with a husband that would abandon his wife and family. Anyway, Richard started thinking that this women had nothing to do with Ernest taking off so many years ago. 
Richard found out that Ernest had hopped a train and ended up in Texas. Where he started a new life. Married (bigamist). and raised a second family. 
Eventually Richard Traveled to Texas and met his step-siblings. He seemed to recall several sisters and a brother. (As told to me by Richard J Sturm)
