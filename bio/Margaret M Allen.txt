Margaret M. Gooding
(nee Allen)


	My earliest memories of Margaret were from visits that I went on with my parents.  We would take the train or bus into the city to see Aunt Margaret.  She lived in a big apartment building on the northside of the city.  I can remember climbing the stairs to her apartment.  All the way up to the third floor.  It seemed a long  climb at the time.

	Once inside the apartment I was ushered into the front room and told not to touch anything.  Usually given a small toy to occupy myself.  While my parents would go off into the kitchen and talk.  I can still remember the smells of the apartment building.

	One time I remember going down-town to the Palmer House to see Aunt Margaret.  We had lunch with her. I remember having  cream cheese and jelly on toast.  While my mom had another sandwich and chatted with Margaret.

	I can also recall that her sister lived with her and took care of the apartment.  Her name was Ellen.  Apparently she was in an accident earlier in her life.  And she was crippled. I think she had a limp.
