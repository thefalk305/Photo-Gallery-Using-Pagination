Dennis Allen

	Dennis Allen and Ellen Slattery were married on the 10 of Aug. 1851. At St. John the Baptist Church in Albany, N.Y. By the Rev. Pat'k McCloskey.  After the marriage they lived with Ellen's mother at 64 Ranssellaer St.

	Dennis died of typhus fever while in the Union Army, on the 9th of July, 1862.  He was probably between 31 to 36 yrs. old when he died.  This would mean that he was probably born between 1831 to 1836. His parents were presumed both alive, along with a brother (Willian). Dennis was survived by his parents (Unknown at this time), wife (Ellen), and two children (Gerauld & William). I have a letter from John Smith, a friend of Dennises that was with him when he died.  They were in the army together: Co."C", 34th Regiment, N.Y. Vols. He was enrolled on the 1st of May, 1861.

St. John the Baptist Founded 1837 closed in 1978 and merged with St. Ann's Church later St Ann's Merged with St. James' Church in 2010 to form the St. Francis of Assisi Parish...Buildings still remain. St John records are held at St Francis Albany, NY
