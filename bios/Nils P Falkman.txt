Brief Life History of Nils Peter.

Nils Peter Falkman
      
     Nils Pitt Johansson (Falkman) is my Great-grand-father's Swedish name.  Upon coming to this country his name was anglicized. Some documents refer to him as Peter N. Falkman, or Nils P. Falkman or just N. P. Falkman.  For all intensive purposes these are one and the same person.
  
	Nils was born on a Thursday, the 30th of April, 1863. On a small farm in Hinneryd, Kronoberg, Sweden. The name of the farm was Svenshult. Nils's father, Johan Nilsson, was a blonde farmer. Or peasant farmer. As was his father before him. Johan was given a small farm in return for working so many days a month for the land owner. Nils was the youngest of the children born to Johan and Karna (his mother). Nils had four siblings. An older brother Pehr, who was some 16 yrs older than him. Another brother Ola, who would have been 14 yrs older than Nils. A third brother named Johannes. Johannes would be about 11 yrs. older than Nils. And then came his sister, Johanna Kristina. She was a little more than 4 yrs. older then Nils. Actually Nils had a second sister. Her name was also Johana Kristina, but she died about 4 months after she was born.

	Nils probably grew up like most children of that time. He had some home schooling, and had his own choirs to do around the house and farm. I have some communion records of Nils as he grew up. But not much more. At around 2 1/2 years of age Nils's mother passes away. She was only 44 yrs. old. But with out our modern medicines there wasn't much that could be done if one got sick. One thing I've come to realize, in doing my research, is that death was a common thing back in the 1700's and 1800's. Most, if not all families had at least one if not more deaths in the family. With in a year of Nils's mother dying, his father remarries. This could partly be out of necessity. With several young children in the home, there would have to be someone to take care of them. And with Johan working the fields, a woman was necessary to keep house and raise the children. So it was that Nils acquired a stepmother. Whom was previously married (a widow) and had several children of her own. Anna Stina Svensdotter was her name. And she raised Nils until he was old enough to be out on his own.
      
	Nils left his home in Hinneryd, Kronoberg, Sweden, (Province of Summerbo) in October of 1891.  From there he traveled to Hudiksvall, county of Gävleborg. As of yet I have not discovered why he traveled to Hudiksvall. But I know that Karin (his future wife also traveled to Hudiksvall for a short period of time. Any way he left Hudiksvall on Tuesday, October 6th and headed for Götenborg and sailed on the SS Romeo. A smaller inter coastal ship that would take him to Hull, England. From Hull it would be a train ride to Liverpool. There he would board the HMS Britannic to America. The ship would more than likely  stop  first at Queens Town. And then on to America.  The Britannic finally landed in America.  At the port of New York.  Once in America Peter traveled to DuBois, Pa. (DuBois is in Clearfield County).  It wasn't clear why Peter had decided to go to DuBois, Pa. But I recently found out that he had a brother living in DuBois, John Löfgren. John being more than ten years older then Peter had travelled to America some five or six years earlier. And settled in DuBois, Pa. Once Peter settled in, he plied his trade as a shoemaker and waited for his fiancé to arrive.                                 
	 
	The following year his future wife Katherine (Corine Noren as stated on their marriage license) arrived from Sweden.  They applied for a marriage license in the county court house on May 25, 1892.  And three days later they had a church wedding. While in DeBois his first child, a son, was born, Herman.  Shortly after Herman was born Peter decided to have the family moved to Chicago.  The families first home would be on Walton St. Where Peter continued to make a living making and repairing shoes. Four more children were born while living in Chicago. Lillian, Ester, Theodore, & Robert.


	Nils Falkman lived and worked in several different places in and around Chicago.  These are the locations and occupations:
                                                                        
Earliest   (1896-1899)    187 Walton St.   	 Occupation - Shoemaker
              (1900-1901)  766 W. Lake St.              "         Shoemaker
              (1901-1906) 2676 W. Lake St.            "           Laborer  C&OP RR

Last        (1915-1917) 4825 W. Race Ave.          "          Carpenter C&OP RR
     
Peter also belonged to the order K. of P. ( Knights of Pythias), a fraternal order founded in Washington, D.C., in 1864.	

	Finally after several years, sometime in 1901, Peter landed a job working for the C&OP RR (Chicago & Oak Park Rail Road) now commonly called the CTA or RTA.  It appears that he may have held several positions while employed for the Lake street elevated.  He was eventually killed in an accident while working on the Elevated train.  This happened on November 26, 1918. Peter was waked for two days and then interned on the 28th of November at Elm Lawn Cemetery, in Elmhurst, IL.                                                                                                    

	Peter's fathers name was Johan Nilsson. And his mothers name was Karna Persdotter. Peter's original name was Nils Pit Johansson. When Peter was conscripted into the army in Sweden there were so many Johansson's that he was asked to change his name.  He decided to change his name to Falkman. His brother John, who was in the army in Sweden also changed his name.  He chose Löfgren. Supposedly because this was his wife's maiden name.             

	After Peters death. The family moved to the Austin area of Chicago. Purchased a home. (I'm sure the money for the home was a settlement with the rail road) The address there was: 5508 W. Hadden, There Karin and the rest of the family lived out their lives.
