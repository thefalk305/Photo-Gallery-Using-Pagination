Helen K. Alexander

	My mom was born on the 3rd of March, 1921 in Hackettstown, New Jersey. She was the youngest of three children. Unfortunately, she didn't speak much of her childhood and I haven't been able to find out much about her as she was growing up. 
FLASH... Helen K. Alexander baptized, 13 Mar. 1921

	I do know that she met my dad at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, during the war. And there they had a whirlwind romance and were married at one of the chapels in Camp Kilmer.
