Violet Alexander

Violet was born to Frank and Ida Alexander.
They lived in New Jursey.
Violet has a sister, Helen K. and a brother Frink Jr.

Note: 1930 Census has Alexander family listed in Sparta, Sussex county, State of N. J. Violet is listed as Malley Alexander. Census taker wrote Malley and then erased the M and put a W in place of the M. But if you look at the actual page its hard to determine which letter should be written. Mom's sister's name was actually Violet. But because she wasn't the best looking girl in town the family (and maybe others) called her 'Wall Flower'. The name sort of stuck. And after years the family just called her Wally. When the census taker came by for the 1930 census. She was listed as Walley. More than likely grandma Ida or grandpa Frank were interviewed. And neither spoke very good English. And that's how the entry in the 1930 census came to be.

The truth or maybe a better definition of the historical facts is that my aunt's name was Waclawa, which is polish for Violet. So maybe she wasn't a 'wall flower', like the paragraph above suggests. But rather a beautiful flower of a girl. Like a Violet.
