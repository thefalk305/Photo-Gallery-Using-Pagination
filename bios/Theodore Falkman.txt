    Theodore became very upset and unstable after his father (Peter Nils) died. He was placed in Manteno State Hospital on the 30th of November, 1940. Where he was treated for Dementia Praecox. Which he had for some 11 years. Theodore also had a coronary problem. Which finally killed him. He died on July 2nd, 1944. At one time I had a little wooden boat made by Theodore along with a cribbage board. The boat has long been lost. Maybe in moving to Oak Park. The cribbage board I still have. And use it to play cribbage.
