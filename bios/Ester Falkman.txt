I don't know much about Ester. Outside of the fact that  she stayed home and took care of the house and her mother (Karen). When Ester was younger she had a job, I think with a photograph company... She had 'an affair' with a fellow employee (maybe her boss), and became pregnant. I don't know what happened to the child, whether she put it up for adoption or had the pregnancy aborted. I think maybe the child was placed up for adoption. After that Ester stayed at home taking care of her mother (Karin). I wish I knew more. She was a good looking women.
