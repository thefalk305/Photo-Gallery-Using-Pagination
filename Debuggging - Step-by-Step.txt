Step-by-Step: Debug PhotoPages.js in VSCode
✅ 1. Serve Your Project Locally
If you're not already using a local server:
- Install the Live Server extension in VSCode
- Right-click your PhotoPages.html → "Open with Live Server"
- This will launch your site at something like http://127.0.0.1:5500

🛠️ 2. Create a Debug Configuration
- Open the Run and Debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D)
- Click “create a launch.json file”
- Choose “Chrome” or “Edge” (depending on your browser)
- Use this config:
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "pwa-chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug PhotoPages.js in Chrome",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5500",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "breakOnLoad": true
    }
  ]
}

🎯 3. Set Breakpoints
- Open PhotoPages.js in VSCode
- Click to the left of any line number to set a breakpoint (e.g. inside your fetch() or modal logic)

▶️ 4. Start Debugging
- In the Run panel, select “Debug PhotoPages.js in Chrome”
- Click the green ▶️ button
- Chrome will launch and attach to VSCode
- Execution will pause at your breakpoints, and you’ll see variables, call stacks, and scopes
