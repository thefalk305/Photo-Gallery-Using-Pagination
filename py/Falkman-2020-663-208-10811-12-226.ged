Patricia passed away Jan 2014. </span><span>My early years.</span><span>by Yours truly</span><span>My earliest recollections.... I was born Bernard Allen Falkman, in Oak Park hospital.... my total hospital bill&nbsp; was $34.95 for a 5 day stay. (I still have the receipt) at that time my Mom was living with my fathers mother at Long and Augusta (Austin Area, in the city.) The war was still going on and father was overseas. Mom was in Casablanca when she found out that she was pregnant... and she was shipped back stateside. </span></p><br /><p><span>My father had met my Mom when he was stationed at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. He was a First Ltd. and Mom was a Second Ltd. (she was an army nurse and out ranked him) </span></p><br /><p><span>At the end of the war father returned home with a promise of a job in Calif. So we took the train to San Mateo... Two day ride on the train... While out there, father worked as a chemist for the American Can Company.&nbsp; We stayed in Calif. for 2 years and there my brothers Jerry and Richard were born.</span></p><p><span>A few thing that I can remember from San Mateo are that one day I decided to grab my moms sewing tin (old cookie tin) Dump out the contents and went looking for worms. Just a block away and you were at the foot of the mountains.... Anyway, I went digging for worms... and found a whole bunch of them... But them in the empty sewing tin. And brought them back to show mom.... When she opened the tin, she screamed and dropped the tin.... Apparently I hadn&#39;t gathered up worms... but baby rattle snakes.... She beat them to death right there on the kitchen floor... Must have been about a half-dozen of them.... So much for my worm hunting.... </span></p><br /><p><span>Another time I can remember is that we had a white picket fence around the yard... and daredevil me would climb up and stand on the top horizontal rail... One evening as dad pulled into the drive way while I was on top of the fence... Suddenly I slipped and was caught around the neck between two of the pickets... Not tall enough, I couldn&#39;t get out of this. I almost hung myself... Thank God dad was there and pulled me off the fence or that would have been the end of me... So much for my fence climbing.... </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember that father had a friend and he flew airplanes. One weekend he took Mom and me up for a flight. Everything was great until Mom got a little scared and then I threw up all over the cockpit....&nbsp; So much for plane rides. </span></p><br /><p><span>About the only other thing that I remember (and this is something I was told) was that right across the street there lived a gangster.... And one evening the local police surrounded the place with squads and were ready to do battle if the guy didn&#39;t come out peaceful.... But I didn&#39;t witness it... I was told years later...</span></p><p><span>After the two boys were born. It was off back to Chicago.... We stayed for a short while on Long and Augusta, this was my father&#39;s parents home. And then we moved to 19th Ave. in Maywood. We rented an old two story frame house from someone my father knew at work. I can remember we took in a border. His name was Clem, can&#39;t remember his last name. We had a fire place in the living room and I can remember on Saturday nights we would all gather round and pop, popcorn. I can also recall that our mom was working at Westlake Hospital at the time. And when it came time for us to have our flu shots. She would line us boys up on the edge of the bed. Butts in the air, and go right down the line, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch. </span></p><br /><p><span>A couple more things I can remember, was that one Christmas we got a blackboard from &#39;Santa&#39; And a friend of father&#39;s (Mike Murphy) had used chalk to draw a picture of Santa. Coming down the stairs that morning, I saw the picture in the dimly lit living room. And it scared the crap out of me... Wouldn&#39;t come down until mom assured me that everything was OK... </span></p><br /><p><span>Last but not least I can remember father taking 8mm motion pictures of us. One was titled &quot;How to make babies&quot;. He had a big cardboard box on the kitchen table. And would reach inside and pull out one of the boys... I was first. Then he would stop the camera, put Jerry in the box and start the camera again. And pull out Jerry. Then repeat the procedure for Dick... </span></p><br /><p><span>The next movie was &quot;How to Grow Baby&quot;. This time he laid the box on its side, Put me in on one end of the box and Jerry in at the other end. Then dad and Clem would start pulling each end. Me by the shoulders and Jerry by the feet. Kind of like stretching one boy out. </span></p><br /><p><span>This was the first year I attended school. It was kindergarten and the school was Irving Middle School.. And then it was out to Lombard. We lived on Ethel about 2 blocks off of main. We were the only house for 2 square blocks... </span></p><br /><p><span>By now Mom was pregnant with Robert. I can remember going to Sacred Heart Catholic school... And we raised chickens... from eggs.. Watched them hatch and grow... and from those chickens, more eggs. I can remember going out to the hen house on a cold winters day to fetch eggs... In my barefoot. And once in the chicken coop the chicken shit oozing up between my toes.... Yuck...... Also, on Sundays, once the chickens were too old to lay eggs. Father would grab a couple of them and wacky, off with there heads... they would run around the back yard for 20 - 30 seconds before falling over dead. Then Mom would dunk them in a pail of boiling water to remove the feathers.... She would then clean them up and fry them.... Mmmmm Good eatin&#39;.</span></p><br /><p><span>I can also remember my mother learning to drive a car while we lived there... Nothing but empty corn fields around us for 2 square blocks.... </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember my brother Richard falling and almost cutting off two if his fingers... He had fallen on a cycle... and rushing him to the hospital to sew them back on.... Thank God he didn&#39;t lose them. </span></p><br /><p><span>I can remember that we had a black cocker spaniel. Called her &#39;Bonnie Dog&#39;.... And one spring morning she disappeared.... Under the porch to deliver 6 of the prettiest puppies you could ever have seen. We only stayed for about a year, year and a-half.(owner died and his family wanted to sell the place). </span></p><br /><p><span>I do remember the winter we spent in Lombard. I had gotten a sled for Christmas. I wanted to take it out and try it out... Mom bundled me up so I would be nice and worm and off I went with my new sled... Down at the end of the road there was a cross street (Finley), had a nice slope to it. You could go for about 100 yards before you would stop. I remember sliding down the road and putting my tongue on the bare metal of the sled. Well, everyone knows what happens when you put something wet on to frozen metal. There I was laying in the middle of the street, on my sled, with my tongue stuck permanently to the sled. Now I started to panic, what if a car came down the road? That would have been the end of me... So I tried to roll off the road, but the sled was too wide for me to get it to roll. So here I am stuck in the middle of this road, praying that a car doesn&#39;t come running along... But anyway, I somehow got my tongue off the sled and headed home. Needless to say I never put my tongue on that sled again. </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember, that mom and dad would sit in the living room and listen to the radio after dinner. And one evening dad hooked up the radio to a microphone up in our bedroom... So when they sat down and started listening to the radio the three of us started singing on the radio... Surprised mom... I think it was her birthday and we sang &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; over the radio to her... </span></p><p><span>From Lombard we moved back to the city... Way up north on Touhy. It was a housing project for returning service man. I started 1st grade at St. Julianas... (This was a housing project for returning service personal and their families.... ) I must have been 7 at the time. The only recollection I have of Touhy is that we had brought Bonnie Dog with us... But she couldn&#39;t get use to the streets or the traffic... almost got run over several times... So we had to get give her up.... </span></p><br /><p><span>Also, had chicken pocks at this time. along with my&nbsp; brothers (now 4) We didn&#39;t stay long on Touhy... About 6 months. And then we moved to another housing project on Foster and Killborn. (now it&#39;s a forest preserve meadow) School this time was St. Cornelius</span></p><p><span>I can remember taking the bus to school along with 2 of my brothers.(school was about 2 miles away)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the summer we would take our bus money and buy candy... and then walk home... Things that I can remember about living on Foster are the Schwinn bike I got from my grand-father. It was an old second hand Schwinn. Herman had cleaned it up and repainted it like new. Boy, I was free, road that bike all over. To the park, the store, all over the&nbsp; housing project. </span></p><br /><p><span>Miss Slattery was my third grade teacher. Mean as all get-out. I think she was the only lay teacher at St. Cornelius. I was left handed and she would make me wear this thick wool mitten on my left hand so I would have to use my right hand to write with... Didn&#39;t work... I would sneak the glove off and write lefty.... </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember an incident where all the boys were standing in line for a turn in the washroom... and everyone is pushing and shoving... Well the kid in front of me slips... I think the floor was wet... But anyway... the nuns grabbed me and said I pushed him (he had split his head open and had to be taken to the hospital). I said no I had not pushed him.. and was crying... But they insisted I did and I was sent home to tell my mother... I got home and I was so scared that I went right to bed.. and didn&#39;t say a word. The nuns later found out that the floor was wet and the kid did slip. When my Mom found out about the incident she went to school and really gave them hell.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I can remember walking home on summer days... Me and my brothers would go by a glass factory ... and they would dump all the broken glass out along the railroad tracks.... The company made stain glass windows ... and we would pick up all different colors of glass... Red&#39;s, purples, greens blues, yellows, black, and white, and just about any color in between...&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>I can remember the swimming pool 2 blocks away and the playground... I can remember going to the store for my Mom... She wanted a gal. of milk... Gave me a $5 bill... Half way to the store, I lose the money... Boy was I in deep shit.... I had to go back and tell her. </span></p><br /><p><span>I also remember the 4 of us boys sleeping in one bed. (double bed) One night my brother Jerry and I slept with our heads together (touching) And when we woke up in the morning we had both dreamed the same dream... I would say I saw this in my dream and he would pick up were I left off.... Amazing... And the whole dream was about this new place and new school.... </span></p><br /><p><span>We stayed on Foster for three years. and then moved to Kedzie and Belmont. This is St. Veronica&#39;s parish... The first week that we (bros. &amp; I) went to school. My brother Jerry and I recognized the route that we were taking to school... It was all in our dream months earlier... The candy store. the street and intersections... the way to school... Wow..... This is my recollection of 4th grade.. I can remember the Fridays during lent... We would go to communion and then we would have milk and doughnuts... That was great... I can remember helping the janitor go around and clean the floors... When it came to the girls washroom... he would swear and say that the girls restrooms were 3 times dirtier than the boys washrooms.. I can also remember helping the nuns at the Convent. It made me feel good and I&#39;m sure I was praised for it.... </span></p><br /><p><span>Another thing that I remember is that we moved once, two blocks away... Stayed in the same parish.... Now we were living on Whipple.. Just off Belmont. At this location I can remember seeing my first TV. The father of the family down stairs worked for some electronics company... (Maybe Motorola or something like that.) Anyway it was a round TV tube and we would go down stairs and watch Howdy Doody and some other comedy programs. I can remember a school friend of mine having a race with my brother Jerry, who could climb a tree the fastest. There were several Sycamores across the street... My friend climbed to the very top.... But before he could start down, he slipped and fell 2 stories... injured his back... the ambulance came and took him away.... </span></p><br /><p><span>We stayed a year all together. And then moved to Maywood... 1829 S. 20th Ave.</span></p><p><span>In Maywood, I attended Roosevelt Elementary School. Down on 15th and Lexington. We lived on 20th and Lexington. So it wasn&#39;t such a long distance to go. Started 5th grade there... Teachers name was Miss Babcock. Don&#39;t remember 6th grade or the teacher... Seventh grade I had Mr. Robinson. and in eighth grade I had... hmmm can&#39;t remember just now. Just remembered, it was Mrs. Hunter.</span></p></div>

1 NOTE Wednesday Journal, Feb. 15, 2006
2 CONT 
2 CONT Oak Park police arrested two men early Sunday morning who had escaped around
2 CONT midnight Saturday from a maximum security unit of Cook County Jail. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The two men were among six inmates being held in the maximum security Special
2 CONT Incarceration Unit at the jail who escaped after a seventh inmate was able to
2 CONT overpower the lone guard on duty.
2 CONT 
2 CONT David Earnest, 38, was awaiting trial on aggravated murder charges. Arnold
2 CONT Joyner, 42, was being held on theft charges, and had reportedly attempted to
2 CONT escape last month.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The escape was the second in two days from the maximum security division of the
2 CONT jail. On Friday, Warren Mathis, 35, a suspect in the July armed robbery of the
2 CONT Buzz Cafe, 905 S. Lombard Ave., slipped out of the jail in the back of a laundry
2 CONT truck. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Mathis, who had been living in Forest Park while on parole last year, was
2 CONT recaptured Saturday in Lyons.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Area police departments had been notified of the other escapees after county
2 CONT jail officials sent a teletype to all police agencies throughout the northern
2 CONT Illinois region, according to Oak Park Police Chief Rick Tanksley. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Tanksley said that the first indication police here had that any escapees were
2 CONT in the village came when West Suburban Consolidated Dispatch Center
2 CONT telecommunicator James Falkman alerted a patrol officer.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Falkman, a 29-year-old Oak Park native and five-year Auxilary Forest Park police
2 CONT officer, was driving home around 6:30 a.m. after his overnight shift at the
2 CONT dispatch center. He had just turned north onto Ridgeland Avenue at Lake Street
2 CONT when he saw two men dressed in tan pants and white T-shirts walk out of an alley
2 CONT on the west side of Ridgeland.
2 CONT 
2 CONT His suspicions aroused, Falkman did a U-turn and drove back westbound on Lake
2 CONT and drove to the Pilgrim Congregational parking lot, where he'd seen a police
2 CONT squad car parked.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Meanwhile the two men had turned onto Lake and where walking westbound. They
2 CONT turned around when they saw the squad car.
2 CONT 
2 CONT After Falkman alerted her, Officer Dawn Carver drove over and stopped the pair
2 CONT just north of the El viaduct on Ridgeland. When she got out of her squad,
2 CONT though, the two men bolted in different directions.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Falkman said Carver pursued Earnest under the viaduct, while Joyner ran by him.
2 CONT Falkman then exited his car and ordered Joyner to get on the ground. He
2 CONT complied, Falkman said, for about 20 seconds, before getting up again and
2 CONT running toward Lake Street.
2 CONT 
2 CONT At that point Carver drove by and followed Joyner to the athletic fields on the
2 CONT west side of the ice skating rink. As Falkman watched from Lake Street, he said
2 CONT Carver got out of the squad and ordered Joyner to stop. Apparently realizing he
2 CONT had nowhere to go, he placed his hands on the south east field backstop. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Meanwhile, Officer Bob Ritchie took Earnest into custody on the other side of
2 CONT the train tracks in the 400 block of South Boulevard. Earnest and Joyner
2 CONT reportedly first told Oak Park police that all six escaped inmates got off a
2 CONT westbound train in Oak Park. That was later proved to be untrue, but police,
2 CONT assuming other escapees were still in the area, took no chances. A command
2 CONT center was set up in the Pilgrim Congregational Church parking lot across from
2 CONT Ridgeland Common.
2 CONT 
2 CONT All officers working the midnight shift were kept on duty, and teamed up in
2 CONT two-man cars with officers reporting for the morning shift. SWAT team officers
2 CONT were also called in to duty, as were members of the department's detective
2 CONT bureau. In addition, officers from Chicago, Cook County Sheriff's Department,
2 CONT Forest Park, River Forest, Metra, the Chicago Transit Police, Union Pacific
2 CONT Railroad, and the U.S. Marshals Service joined in an extensive search effort.
2 CONT 
2 CONT "We got a lot of help from a lot of people," said Deputy Chief Bob Scianna. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Police set up a search perimeter bounded by Lake Street on the north, Madison
2 CONT Avenue on the south, Ridgeland on the east and Harlem Avenue to the west. Power
2 CONT on the CTA tracks from Central Avenue in Chicago to Harlem Avenue was shut off,
2 CONT and eight Oak Park officers, assisted by Chicago and Forest Park K-9 units,
2 CONT searched a freight train stopped on the tracks. That train, which stretched from
2 CONT near Austin Boulevard to Harlem Avenue, was "searched from top to bottom," said
2 CONT Scianna. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Other officers inspected a CTA Green Line train. Police also were kept busy
2 CONT throughout the early morning hours checking apartment entrances, alleys and
2 CONT backyards in the area. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Meanwhile, back at the police station, the one person on desk duty, community
2 CONT service officer Ivan Vanek, was being deluged with hundreds of calls from
2 CONT residents seeking information after waking up to the penetrating drone of
2 CONT helicopters hovering overhead.
2 CONT 
2 CONT "I'm losing my voice," said a rather weary Vanek just after 11 a.m. "The
2 CONT switchboard's been lit up all morning,"
2 CONT 
2 CONT Over at the West Suburban Consolidated Dispatch Center, the midnight shift was
2 CONT just getting off duty. When the call came in regarding the possibility of four
2 CONT escapees in Oak Park, supervisor Vanessa Underwood asked two dispatchers from
2 CONT the midnight shift to stay on to assist the five dispatchers starting their
2 CONT shift.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Things got intense quickly. Besides handling heavy dispatch traffic and incoming
2 CONT phone calls, the center's staff had to make the phone calls ordering additional
2 CONT manpower for the Oak Park force, including SWAT officers and detectives. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Ron Gross, the dispatch center deputy director, said Sunday wasn't the first
2 CONT time center staff had to work under such pressure.
2 CONT 
2 CONT "We've done it before," he said. "They're kind of used to it."
2 CONT 
2 CONT Still, he said he was proud of his troops.
2 CONT 
2 CONT "They did an outstanding job, not that that's unusual for them. They worked so
2 CONT well together. I'm very pleased."
2 CONT 
2 CONT So were Oak Park police brass, who contacted Gross Monday to express their
2 CONT appreciation.
2 CONT 
2 CONT "They were very pleased," said Gross.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Police were also pleased with Falkman.
2 CONT 
2 CONT "It was more than impressive," said Scianna, who noted that he sent an email to
2 CONT Gross. "It's a credit to his professionalism as a dispatcher. To not only
2 CONT recognized the suspects, but to help facilitate their apprehension." 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Besides Joyner and Earnest, escapees included Tyrone Everhart, 28, charged with
2 CONT aggravated kidnapping and attempted escape from the Markham Court House; Michael
2 CONT Macintosh, 30, who was arrested for aggravated battery with possession of a
2 CONT firearm; Erin Bernard, 22, who was arrested for armed robbery; and Francisco
2 CONT Romero, 23, who has been in jail for 4½ years and is awaiting trial for murder.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jail spokesman Bill Cunningham blamed the escape in large measure to "a severe
2 CONT understaffing problem" at the jail, where he said guards are spread thin. The
2 CONT escape might have been prevented had there been a second guard present in the
2 CONT shower area, he said.
2 CONT 
2 CONT While all the drama was going on, the person who had triggered the capture,
2 CONT Falkman, was home trying to get some sleep. He had a double shift to work later
2 CONT that afternoon.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Asked if he managed to catch any shut-eye, Falkman said with a half laugh, "No.
2 CONT Not really."

1 NOTE <div><p style="font-family:Segoe UI Variable, Segoe UI, Ari;"><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;"><span>Richard John Falkman</span></span><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;" /><span>Born in 1947, in San Mateo, California, Dick began his education in Chicago elementary schools to eventually land for a longer stint at Roosevelt Elementary, in west suburb, Maywood.&nbsp; With an inherent love of learning, Dick’s work-ethic landed him in the top </span><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span>1%</span></span><span>&nbsp;of his </span><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span>1965</span></span><span>&nbsp;Proviso East graduating class.&nbsp; </span></p><br /><p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:17pt;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dick’s college career began at Bradley University in Peoria, with his schoolwork was at that time focused on Psychology.&nbsp; In another direction, Dick eventually became the president of his social fraternity.&nbsp; Not all was fun-and-games, however, with Dick washing dishes, five days a week, for all four years of his college career.&nbsp; And, the second day of each summer vacation began with his 7-days-a-week employment at a National Can tin sheet printing factory.&nbsp; Dick’s Bradley graduation and the subsequent marriage to his wonderful wife, Ohio girl Mary Ann Cochran, took place in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span>1970</span></span><span>.</span></p><br /><p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:17pt;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The next phase of Dick’s academic pursuits took him to his M.A. graduate program in School Psychology – at Western Illinois U. in Macomb.&nbsp; This degree prepared Dick for his initial employment as a Certified School Psychologist in the public school system of Calumet City, Illinois.&nbsp; However, after five years in this role, Dick felt considerably constrained as a </span><span style="font-style:italic;"><span>“Test Administrator”</span></span><span>&nbsp;– and decided to return to school, i.e. University of Illinois (Chicago), in an electrical engineering discipline.&nbsp; With the wonderful arrival of their son, Ryan, in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#EE0000;"><span>1975</span></span><span>, the situation was decidedly more exciting -- and also more challenging -- requiring Dick’s participation in a Work-Study program.&nbsp; Most thankfully, there was the incredible patience and support of his wife, Mary Ann.&nbsp; Dick graduated in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#EE0000;"><span>1980</span></span><span>&nbsp;and was offered employment at Bell Laboratories, in Naperville, Illinois.</span></p><p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:17pt;"><span>&nbsp; Dick began work there in hardware design, with his first assignment being to develop a replacement for AT&amp;T’s current (electro-mechanical) Operator Console.&nbsp; Dick’s VDT-based design incorporated an electronically-controlled means of varying precise screen location of image, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:16pt;"><span>(to minimize CRT phosphor “burn-in”)</span></span><span>&nbsp;– for which he was granted a U.S. patent.&nbsp; </span></p><p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:17pt;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; So much for such “design fun”, as Dick was selected to lead the national deployment of Operator Office software releases, including the project planning of final lab testing and then as “front-man” for negotiating software-hardware testing in “live” AT&amp;T telephony offices.&nbsp; {At about this time, Dick was promoted to </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><span>Distinguished</span></span><span>&nbsp;Member of Technical Staff, acquiring for him his own office and </span><span style="font-style:italic;"><span>“a few dollars more”</span></span><span>.}</span></p><br /><p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:17pt;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, this nation-wide methodology gave way to in-house testing programs, supported within a multi-lab environment at now-divested Lucent-Technologies, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:15pt;"><span>(still in Naperville)</span></span><span>, with the primary planning for which being Dick’s responsibility.&nbsp; The writing was on the wall, however, when one of his last assignments was to train visiting engineers to assume remote Customer Support.&nbsp; So, after </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#EE0000;"><span>26 years</span></span><span style="color:#EE0000;"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>of highly-challenging technical work – and 5 of 6 corporate down-sizes -- Dick succumbed to the inevitable layoff in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#EE0000;"><span>2007</span></span><span style="color:#EE0000;"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>– just in time for his Social Security!</span></p><p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:17pt;"><span>================= </span></p><p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:17pt;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have herein read, from an early age Dick has been highly motivated to achieve in whatever opportunities lay before him – and so his </span><span style="font-style:italic;"><span>work-ethic</span></span><span>&nbsp;was always accompanied by many </span><span style="font-style:italic;"><span>work-hours</span></span><span>. </span></p><p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:17pt;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; None the less, he has found the time throughout his career to contribute hundreds of hours to humanitarian causes, particularly in his church-parish:&nbsp; e.g., 16 years as Vacation Bible School teacher </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span>and</span></span><span>&nbsp;band-leader, 7 years on the Worship Commission, 14 years as Junior High catechist, etc.&nbsp; So, doesn’t that make Dick “kinda special”?&nbsp; No – not al all;&nbsp; with love for his family and community, he considers these activities to be the minimum he should do to “</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-style:italic;font-size:15pt;"><span>Pay Forward</span></span><span>” God’s blessings.</span></p><br /></div>

1 NOTE Herman Ralph Falkman
2 CONT 
2 CONT      Herman was born in Dubois, Clearfield County, Pa. On September 1st, 1893. He moved to Chicago with his parents when he was a very young child. Herman was the oldest of five children. He attended Emerson Grammar School, Spencer Grammar School, and Austin High School. While in high school he met Mary Allen. His future wife.  High school year book named him "Romeo". After high school he planned on working.
2 CONT 	
2 CONT 	After Herman finished school, he married Mary Allen. They drove out to Elgin and were married by a justice of the piece.  Which didn't sit well with her folks. (Mary being Irish Catholic and Herman being Lutheran). When her mother, Margaret, found out about the Elgin marriage, she make them get married in a Roman Catholic church in Chicago. Herman was hired on with the Chicago Sanitary District. Where he worked as a draftsman. One of his assignments was working on the electrical wiring for the locks at the mouth of the Chicago River. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	My first recollections of Herman are when my mother and I lived with him (Tiki) and (Nani) my grandmother on Long Ave. On the west side of Chicago. This would have been around the end of the Second World War, (1944-1945)  I remember the place well. It was a big stucco frame house. With an entrance on the side. Wicker furniture on the enclosed front porch. I can remember the big bay window and the dining nook in the kitchen. One day I remember playing Superman and I tried to run through the glass storm door on the back porch. Needless to say I still have a scar from that experience. And then there was the time I was told not to play around the outside basement stairs. I could get hurt. So, one concussion and four stitches later I stayed away from the basement stairs. Herman, or Tiki as we called him, was normally a quiet, gentle man. Unless you got in to his desk drawers and messed around with his drafting tools. I remember one time spilling some drawing ink on his desk. When he got home, boy was I in trouble. But most of the time he was a very kind man. I can also remember him taking me out for a walk in the park near be the house. He would bring a golf club and a couple of golf balls. He would hit the balls and I would chase after them and bring them back.
2 CONT 
2 CONT      Herman did a lot of traveling on the family vacations. He did a lot of driving. He also liked photography and took pictures where ever he would travel. He had quit a collection of 8 mm films I can remember. I can remember he had a big Olds 88 that he used to take on his vacation trips.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	When he retired he moved in with his daughter, Bea. And lived with her until his death.
2 CONT  
2 CONT        
2 CONT He lived on Austin & Jackson
2 CONT He lived on Lockwood & Washington
2 CONT He lived on Agusta & Long
2 CONT These are all in the Austin Area.

1 NOTE <div><p><span>Nils Peter Falkman</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nils Pitt Johansson (Falkman) is my Great-grand-father&#39;s Swedish name.&nbsp; Upon coming to this country his name was anglicized. Some documents refer to him as Peter N. Falkman, or Nils P. Falkman or just N. P. Falkman.&nbsp; For all intensive purposes these are one and the same person.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;Nils was born on a Thursday, the 30th of April, 1863. On a small farm in Hinneryd, Kronoberg, Sweden. The name of the farm was Svenshult. Nils&#39;s father, Johan Nilsson, was a blonde farmer. Or peasant farmer. As was his father before him. Johan was given a small farm in return for working so many days a month for the land owner. Nils was the youngest of the children born to Johan and Karna (his mother). Nils had four siblings. An older brother Pehr, who was some 16 yrs older than him. Another brother Ola, who would have been 14 yrs older than Nils. A third brother named Johannes. Johannes would be about 11 yrs. older than Nils. And then came his sister, Johanna Kristina. She was a little more than 4 yrs. older then Nils. Actually Nils had a second sister. Her name was also Johana Kristina, but she died about 4 months after she was born.</span><span>&nbsp;Nils probably grew up like most children of that time. He had some home schooling, and had his own choirs to do around the house and farm. I have some communion records of Nils as he grew up. But not much more. At around 2 1/2 years of age Nils&#39;s mother passes away. She was only 44 yrs. old. But with out our modern medicines there wasn&#39;t much that could be done if one got sick. One thing I&#39;ve come to realize, in doing my research, is that death was a common thing back in the 1700&#39;s and 1800&#39;s. Most, if not all families had at least one if not more deaths in the family. With in a year of Nils&#39;s mother dying, his father remarries. This could partly be out of necessity. With several young children in the home, there would have to be someone to take care of them. And with Johan working the fields, a woman was necessary to keep house and raise the children. So it was that Nils acquired a stepmother. Whom was previously married (a widow) and had several children of her own. Anna Stina Svensdotter was her name. And she raised Nils until he was old enough to be out on his own.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;Nils left his home in Hinneryd, Kronoberg, Sweden, (Province of Summerbo) in October of 1891.&nbsp; From there he traveled to Hudiksvall, county of G&#228;vleborg. As of yet I have not discovered why he traveled to Hudiksvall. But I know that Karin (his future wife also traveled to Hudiksvall for a short period of time. Any way he left Hudiksvall on Tuesday, October 6th and headed for G&#246;tenborg and sailed on the SS Romeo. A smaller inter coastal ship that would take him to Hull, England. From Hull it would be a train ride to Liverpool. There he would board the HMS Britannic to America. The ship would more than likely&nbsp; stop&nbsp; first at Queens Town. And then on to America.&nbsp; The Britannic finally landed in America.&nbsp; At the port of New York.&nbsp; Once in America Peter traveled to DuBois, Pa. (DuBois is in Clearfield County).&nbsp; It wasn&#39;t clear why Peter had decided to go to DuBois, Pa. But I recently found out that he had a brother living in DuBois, John L&#246;fgren. John being more than ten years older then Peter had travelled to America some five or six years earlier. And settled in DuBois, Pa. Once Peter settled in, he plied his trade as a shoemaker and waited for his fianc&#233; to arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;The following year his future wife Katherine (Corine Noren as stated on their marriage license) arrived from Sweden.&nbsp; They applied for a marriage license in the county court house on May 25, 1892.&nbsp; And three days later they had a church wedding. While in DeBois his first child, a son, was born, Herman.&nbsp; Shortly after Herman was born Peter decided to have the family moved to Chicago.&nbsp; The families first home would be on Walton St. Where Peter continued to make a living making and repairing shoes. Four more children were born while living in Chicago. Lillian, Ester, Theodore, &amp; Robert.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;Nils Falkman lived and worked in several different places in and around Chicago.&nbsp; These are the locations and occupations:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Earliest&nbsp;&nbsp; (1896-1899)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 187 Walton St.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occupation - Shoemaker</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1900-1901)&nbsp; 766 W.

( Knights of Pythias), a fraternal order founded in Washington, D.C., in 1864.	</span><span>&nbsp;Finally after several years, sometime in 1901, Peter landed a job working for the C&amp;OP RR (Chicago &amp; Oak Park Rail Road) now commonly called the CTA or RTA.&nbsp; It appears that he may have held several positions while employed for the Lake street elevated.&nbsp; He was eventually killed in an accident while working on the Elevated train.&nbsp; This happened on November 26, 1918. Peter was waked for two days and then interned on the 28th of November at Elm Lawn Cemetery, in Elmhurst, IL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;Peter&#39;s fathers name was Johan Nilsson. And his mothers name was Karna Persdotter. Peter&#39;s original name was Nils Pit Johansson. When Peter was conscripted into the army in Sweden there were so many Johansson&#39;s that he was asked to change his name.&nbsp; He decided to change his name to Falkman. His brother John, who was in the army in Sweden also changed his name.&nbsp; He chose L&#246;fgren. Supposedly because this was his wife&#39;s maiden name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;After Peters death. The family moved to the Austin area of Chicago. Purchased a home. (I&#39;m sure the money for the home was a settlement with the rail road) The address there was: 5508 W. Hadden, There Karin and the rest of the family lived out their lives.Nils Peter Falkman</span></p></div>

1 NOTE Karin Norén
2 CONT      
2 CONT 	Corine, Karin, Catherine, or Kathrine are all variations of the name that was given to my Great-grandmother, Karin Falkman (nee Norén). We, the family, used to call her 'Mongi'
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Katherine as she was call in America. Was born and raised on the out skirts of a small central eastern town called Arbrå.  The local area was known as "Koldamo".  Arbrä is located about 15 Km north of Ballnas, and 5 Km south of Vallsta, along the Ljusnan River. Her home was an old, rather large, structure. Probably built by her grandfather. And each succeeding generation lived in it, as was the custom in those times. And not migrating, hither and thither as was done in the large cities The homestead was near a large wood. With a small inland lake and wood.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Karin mother, Gölin, died when she was about a year old. Karin was the youngest of 3 sisters. Of necessity, it was not long before there was a stepmother installed in the house. Karin's stepmother's name was Stina Sjon Andersdotter. After which there came several more children. Her stepmother was a good and kind mother to them all. And there was no cause for complaint from the older children.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	The first railroad Karin had ever seen was one built through their section of land, when she was about __ years old. The railroad handed out passes for a free ride, when it was completed. The pass would take them from one town to the next, and back again. So Karin, with her father, enjoyed her first train ride. They road to the next town and visited friends.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Karin's father was an intellectual man. He became a lay preacher. And had studied a great deal and wrote considerably. He passed away when Karin was about 14 years old.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Karin Norén immigrated to America in May of 1892. She left from Gothenburg the same as Nils.  She traveled on the SS Norden. Which took her to her first stop, Humburg. From Humburg she traveled by train to Breman. And from Breman, she boarded the SS Trave, a steamer that would take her to New York, America.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Upon her arrival she set off immediately for Du Bois Penn. And there she met up with Peter. And within several months of her arrival she was married. That would have been on the 25th of May 1892.  This leads me to believe that Karin and Peter must have known one another while still in Sweden. Or maybe she was a mail-order-bride. And was contracted to go to Du Bois. Anyway, her first child was born in September of 1893 (Herman).  Shortly after Herman's birth the family decided to move to Chicago, IL.
2 CONT 	
2 CONT 	
2 CONT 	Several years after moving to Chicago, her husband, Peter, landed a job with the rail road. Where he was eventually killed in a work related accident. With the insurance money the family bought a place in the Austin area. This is were the children were raised and went to school.
2 CONT 	
2 CONT 	My earliest memories of her unfortunately are when she was sick and confined to bed.  Her two daughters Lillian and Ester remained in the home. Never marrying.  Ester would take care of her mother and the home. While Lillian would be the 'Bread Winner' of the family. Lillian worked well into her 70's. Eventually retiring to the home on Hadden. The boys on the other hand. Married and moved away from home.

2 CONT 
2 CONT 	My earliest memories of Margaret were from visits that I went on with my parents.  We would take the train or bus into the city to see Aunt Margaret.  She lived in a big apartment building on the northside of the city.  I can remember climbing the stairs to her apartment.  All the way up to the third floor.  It seemed a long  climb at the time.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Once inside the apartment I was ushered into the front room and told not to touch anything.  Usually given a small toy to occupy myself.  While my parents would go off into the kitchen and talk.  I can still remember the smells of the apartment building.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	One time I remember going down-town to the Palmer House to see Aunt Margaret.  We had lunch with her. I remember having  cream cheese and jelly on toast.  While my mom had another sandwich and chatted with Margaret.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	I can also recall that her sister lived with her and took care of the apartment.  Her name was Ellen.  Apparently she was in an accident earlier in her life.  And she was crippled. I think she had a limp.

2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Dennis died of typhus fever while in the Union Army, on the 9th of July, 1862.  He was probably between 31 to 36 yrs. old when he died.  This would mean that he was probably born between 1831 to 1836. His parents were presumed both alive, along with a brother (Willian). Dennis was survived by his parents (Unknown at this time), wife (Ellen), and two children (Gerauld & William). I have a letter from John Smith, a friend of Dennises that was with him when he died.  They were in the army together: Co."C", 34th Regiment, N.Y. Vols. He was enrolled on the 1st of May, 1861.

1 NOTE History of Ellen Slattery
2 CONT 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Ellen Slattery was born sometime in 1833, in Ireland.  Her and her mother migrated to America sometime in the 1840's.  She married Dennis Allen on the 10th  of August 1851.  Ellen had a total of four children. Two of whom died either at child birth or at a very young age. Their first child was born on the 7th of July 1852, named Gerauld Allen.  Their second son, William was born on the 9th of December 1859. It would be logical that the other two children were born between 1852 and 1859. There being a 7 year gap.
2 CONT 
2 CONT      
2 CONT 	The 1860 census has Ellen listed with her husband Dennis and their two children, Gerauld and William. The address that is listed in the census is on Rensselaer St. At this time Ellen is listed to be 26  yrs. old. This is probably the most correct date of her birth.
2 CONT 	
2 CONT 	Dennis died on the 9th of July 1862.  Ellen was 29 at the time, Gerold was 10, and William would have been about 2 1/2 yrs. old.  At this time she was living at 89 Franklin St. in Albany, N.Y. I think she had moved in to live with her mother. On the 6th of March 1868 Ellen applied for a transfer of pension to the Chicago Illinois office.  Where she would travel to and live with relatives, at 243 E. Madison St.
2 CONT      
2 CONT 	By the 1870 census Ellen had established a boarding house and was residing at 285 S. Clinton.  Along with her are her two sons, Gerold & William.
2 CONT      
2 CONT 	The 1880 census has Ellen living at 556 Lafflin (the S.E. corner of west 18th St.  Ellen is listed as being 44 yrs. old and living with her is one son (William).  Gerold would have been 27 yrs. old and presumably married at the time.
2 CONT      Ellen died on Sunday the 3rd of June, 1883. I wonder if she didn't die of a broken heart. What with her son passing away so recently

2 CONT RMS Carmania
2 CONT 
2 CONT Carmania entered service for Cunard Line in 1905, having been christened by Lady Blythswood, the wife of a former aide to Queen Victoria. She and her sister Caronia were the largest ships in the Cunard fleet at the time of their maiden voyages and were designed to be near identical in every aspect except for their machinery.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The two ship's were used by the line to examine merits of two competing propulsion units. Carmania was fitted with the revolutionary yet relatively untested steam turbine engines, while Caronia was completed with traditional quadruple-expansion engines.
2 CONT 
2 CONT After a relatively short time it became apparent that Carmania, with her steam turbines, was both faster and more efficient that Caronia. This important test case convinced Cunard to opt for turbine propulsion in their new super liners; Mauretania and Lusitania.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Carmania ran on the Cunard New York service. In June 1910 a fire broke out aboard while alongside in Liverpool. Although the damage was extensive, it was contained to the passenger accommodation, leaving the valuable machinery undamaged. The ship was subsequently repaired and returned to service.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In October 1913 Carmania received an SOS from the Canadian Northern Steamship Co., liner Volturno. Despite reaching the scene in four hours the weather was so bad that Carmania was forced to stand by until the storm weakened, resulting in the loss of 103 passengers and 30 crew.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Following the outbreak of World War I, Carmania was called into military service. The ship was transformed into an Armed Merchant Cruiser and entered wartime service on 23 August 1914.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Carmania was involved in a fierce battle with the former Hamburg-Amerika liner Cap Trafalgar on 14 September 1914, sinking her advisory. However Carmania was herself extensively damaged and required refurbishment in the dry dock at Gibraltar.
2 CONT 
2 CONT For the remainder of the war Carmania patrolled seas off the coast of Portugal, and was also involved in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Following the armistice, Carmania was returned to Cunard and refurbished. She was used to repatriate Canadian troops before returning to regular passenger services in 1920. She returned to the Liverpool to New York service and during 1923 the passenger accommodation was altered to allow for 425 cabin class, 365 tourist class and 650 3rd class passengers.
2 CONT 
2 CONT She continued in this role until 1931 when she was withdrawn from service and subsequently scrapped.

1 NOTE Violet Alexander
2 CONT 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Note: 1930 Census has Alexander family listed in Sparta, Sussex county, State of N. J. Violet is listed as Malley Alexander. Census taker wrote Malley and then erased the M and put a W in place of the M. But if you look at the actual page its hard to determine which letter should be written. Mom's sister's name was actually Violet. But because she wasn't the best looking girl in town the family (and maybe others) called her 'Wall Flower'. The name sort of stuck. And after years the family just called her Wally. When the census taker came by for the 1930 census. She was listed as Walley. More than likely grandma Ida or grandpa Frank were interviewed. And neither spoke very good English. And that's how the entry in the 1930 census came to be.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The truth or maybe a better definition of the historical facts is that my aunt's name was Waclawa, which is polish for Violet. So maybe she wasn't a 'wall flower', like the paragraph above suggests. But rather a beautiful flower of a girl. Like a Violet.

1 NOTE I don't know much about Ester. Outside of the fact that  she stayed home and took care of the house and her mother (Karen). When Ester was younger she had a job, I think with a photograph company... She had 'an affair' with a fellow employee (maybe her boss), and became pregnant. I don't know what happened to the child, whether she put it up for adoption or had the pregnancy aborted. I think maybe the child was placed up for adoption. After that Ester stayed at home taking care of her mother (Karin). I wish I knew more. She was a good looking women.

1 NOTE Lillian Falkman
2 CONT 
2 CONT      	Lillian was the second of Peter's children.  And the last one to remain living.  She worked well in to her 70's and remained active all her life.  She lived in the family home, in the Austin area, up until the time she moved to Swedish Covenant Home. ( on the north side of Chicago)
2 CONT 
2 CONT      	At the time of her berth, Lillian's parents were living at 187 Walnut St. Chicago, IL. That would be just east of Well's street. Between Lake St. & Fulton. (the street is no longer there).
2 CONT 
2 CONT Lillian graduated from Herbert Spencer School, 1910.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Lillian enjoyed reading, sports and current affairs.  She kept abreast of everything that was going on.  In her later years she became a little hard of hearing.  But still was a delight to be around and talk with.
2 CONT       
2 CONT             
2 CONT Lillian writes:
2 CONT                          My mother, (Karin Norén) was born, 12th of December, 1867. In Arbrä, Sweden. And her childhood was spent on a farm, near the city of Arbrö. Their home was an old, rather large, structure, with a deep and well built stone foundation. The house had been built probably by her grandfather. And each succeeding generation had lived in it. As was the custom. Ant not migrating hither and thither as is done in the large cities.* Her mother died when she was about a year old. She was the youngest of three (3) sisters. Of Necessity, it was not long before there was a stepmother in the house. After which there came several more children. But, she (the stepmother) was good and kind mother to them all. And there was no cause for complaint from the older children.
2 CONT 	      My mother's father, (Pehr Pehrsson Norén). I do not know what adjectives to describe him by. So I put a period(.). He was an intellectual man. Had studied a great deal. And wrote considerable. He was an earnest student of theology and had formulated certain doctrines. Upon which he established a new church, separate from the State Church (Lutheran). Which he called the Free Church, and in which he preached. Many of his writings consisted of religious theses. He also was a fine writer. He was a stone cutter, but as he wan not very rugged, was not able to follow his occupation regularly. Which did not allow the family to become relatively prosperous. although the family was considered one of the well-to-do smaller farmers. He died in the prime of his life, chiefly perhaps because there were no physicians about who could properly diagnose his case. One of his sons had considerable musical talent., In fact, the violin he played was made by himself.
2 CONT 
2 CONT *The homestead was near a large wood, with a small inland lake on one side. Joyous times were had by the children in the lake and wood. The first railroad my mother had ever seen was one built through their section when she was about       years old. The railroad gave passes, when it was completed, from one own to the next. And my mother, with her father, enjoyed her first train ride. when they visited friends in the next town.

1 NOTE Theodore became very upset and unstable after his father (Peter Nils) died. He was placed in Manteno State Hospital on the 30th of November, 1940. Where he was treated for Dementia Praecox. Which he had for some 11 years. Theodore also had a coronary problem. Which finally killed him. He died on July 2nd, 1944. At one time I had a little wooden boat made by Theodore along with a cribbage board. The boat has long been lost. Maybe in moving to Oak Park. The cribbage board I still have. And use it to play cribbage.

1 NOTE Johan Nilsson was born on the 25th of May, 1819. In Sankt Olof, Sweden. There he lived with his parents (Nils & Hanna) and 8 siblings   His oldest brother (Jöns) was 19 years older then himself. And his oldest sister (Agda) was 21 years older then he was. Agda, was probable married and out of the house by the time he was born. Any way it looks like Johan stayed with the family until he was about 21 yrs. of age. In the 1841 house records Johan is living with a couple of friends, in Roflanda. And by later on that year he's moving to Hvitaby.

1 NOTE Pehr Norén (Lars Persson)
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	I do not have much information about Karin's father, Per Norén. All I have to go on are a few notes that great aunt Lillian had jotted down from her mother Karin. (Karin, is Pehr's daughter). Along with several Household Exam's from Sweden. But I will try my best to piece together what I know about Per. (or Pehr)
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Per Larsson (Per Norén's father) was married twice. The first marriage took place in 1834. He was married to a woman named Anna Ersdotter. She was 4 yrs his senior. Anna died a year after the marriage. In 1935. There were not children from this marriage. Per Larson married a second time in 1936, to another woman and her name was Anna Ersdotter also. Prior to the first wife's death, she (Anna 2) was the maid for the Larson family. The second wife was 27 yrs. younger than Per Larsson. And from this marriage Lars was born. 
2 CONT  	
2 CONT 	Lars Persson was born on the 26th of Sept, 1837, and was christened on Oct. 1, 1837.  He is the only child of Pehr Larsson & Anna Ersdotter (the second). Sometime between 1837 and 1839, Lars's name was changed to Per (Pehr) Persson.  About the time of his father's death Per changed his last name from Persson to Norén. If he hadn't his last name would have been Persson (or Pehrsson, after his father).
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	In his later life, Per became a lay disciple for what was called the Swedish Free Church. Later to be called Swedish Covenent Church. He also had a profession of stone mason. But I gather from Karin's notes (transcribed to Lilly). That Per was not the healthiest of people and this prohibited him from practicing his trade. Which I read was a stone mason. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	Pehr would occasionally visit Dr Waldenstrom in Stockholm. Dr. Paul Peter Waldenström (1838-1917) became a leader of the free church movement in Sweden. Not the state church (Lutheran Church) The Free Church would eventually be called "The Covenant Church". Or as it is more commonly know today as "The Swedish Covenant Church". Pehr eventually became a decuple of Dr. Waldenstrom, becoming a lay preacher. Organized a religious community. He also had a building erected in the community for worship. Being a lay minister Per saw to it that there was a church erected for his parishioners. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	It is not an uncommon practice for a 'Traveling Minister' (in Sweden). to have a daughter accompany him on his missionary circuit.  I think this is what Katherine (Karin) did.  Doing laundry or cooking to taking care of her fathers need as they travelled on his circuit.  This may also explain how she came to meet Nils Peter.  He may have seen her at one of the church functions.  They started talking and Peter told her of his forthcoming trip to America.  He may have even asked her to accompany him on his trip.

1 NOTE John Keane, Bridget's (Babe) father. He had 13 children... I think there may have been a fourteenth child. His name was John P. (P for Patrick). It seems he died at the age of 10. When he was born I don't know. Presumably before John Joseph. Just a guess.

1 NOTE Englie... Or Ingrad Löfgren (I think this is her proper name) emigrated to the United States in 1887. She brought with her two (2) children. Clara, & Emma. In the 1900 US Census she is listed as 'Head' of the house. No husband is listed, but she says she is married. Also living with the family are two borders. John Johnson, and a William Beckland. Both from Sweden.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The 1900 Census has the family listed incorrectly. Listing them as 'Lovgreen' When actually the name is spelled 'Löfgren'. Later census correct the miss spelling. But by then the family is split up (i.e. married, or off on their own.)
2 CONT 
2 CONT Altho Ingrad was born in Lovstad, at the time of her wedding she was living in Hamra Sõdregråd. She is listed as a servant or madden (piga)

1 NOTE Richard J. Sturm, 92, Atlanta, Georgia, passed away October 18, 2018 at home after a brief illness. He was predeceased by his wife, Marjorie Morrison. Dick or “Pop” as he was affectionately called by family, was born in Rochester, New York, March 29, 1926, son of Ernest and Genevieve Sturm. His family moved to DuBois, Pennsylvania, where he attended DuBois High School, graduating in 1943. Dick enlisted in the United States Army in 1945 and served until 1947. He trained as a paratrooper, attaining the rank of sergeant, and served in the 82nd and 101st Airborne Division in Belgium and Germany including the Battle of the Bulge. During his illness, his daughter, Cindy, asked him if he always slept in his socks. He replied that after serving in the Battle of the Bulge in the snow and ice, he swore he would never have cold feet again. Among the numerous recognitions for his service during World War II, Dick received the WWII Victory Medal, Good Conduct Medal, EAMET Combat Infantry Badge, Presidential Unit Citation with cluster, and the French Croix de Guerre. He was a member of General Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Honor Guard in Munich Germany. Upon his honorable discharge from the Army, Dick returned home to work at various jobs in his hometown as well as receive a degree from DuBois Business College. He worked for Brockway Glass and Bottling Co. from 1950 to 1988, serving as Southeast Regional Manager. This job brought him to Atlanta Georgia in 1952 where he would meet the love of his life, Marjorie. On their first date, they, along with Margie’s children, Harry and Cindy, went to the old Piedmont Drive In. They married July 3, 1965 at Grace Methodist Church, officiated by Dr. Cecil Myers. Margie and Dick enjoyed many activities including yearly trips to Williamsburg, Virginia as well as being active members in the Atlanta Scottie Club. He also accompanied Margie on her numerous shopping trips to Phipps Plaza and Lenox Square. Dick and Margie were happily married until her death in 2002. Dick devoted his life to Margie and their children and grandchildren. Dick enjoyed family gatherings and loved visiting with his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. Dick also enjoyed visiting Cheyenne, Wyoming, Vancouver BC, New York City, Dubois and Bradford Pennsylvania to see family. He was the last surviving WWII veteran of the North Georgia Airborne Association and a member of the World War II Roundtable. Dick loved reading books, particularly Western novels and those pertaining to WWII. He was a true hero and patriot who not only served his country but devoted himself to his family. He is survived by son and daughter-in-law, Harry and Janie Hammond of Roswell and their daughters Laura Conrad (Kevin) and daughter Abby; Beth Allison (Chris) and son, Connor, and daughter Amelia; daughter Cindy and Robert Smith, their daughters Blake of Vancouver BC and Lindsay of Brooklyn New York; sisters Ernestine Stroud, Jeanette Tuthill, Martha Ziegler, and Evelyn Allen (and family); nieces Susan Sullivan (Bill), Judy Ginter and Andy Swaney (Dave); sister-in-law Helen Morrison, nephew Steve Morrison (Trish) and family.

Arrangements made by Patterson & Son Spring Hill, 1020 Spring Street NW, Atlanta Georgia 30309, 404-876-1022.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Richard lives outside of Atlanta GA. I called and talked to him a few years back (2012-2013) He had some interesting stories to tell...
2 CONT 
2 CONT His dad, Ernest Sturm was a railroad worker in and around Rochester, NY. and that one day he went to work, (he was a rail yard foreman) and never came home. The family looked high and low. The police were called in. And Ernest was never found. This prompted Jennie to move back to DuBois PA. Where she still had family and friends.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Some 40 odd years later Richard gets a call from a woman in Texas. She informs him that she is his step-sister, and could they get together. Richard refuses and hangs up the phone. Several times this woman calls, with the same results.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Then one day a year or so later Richard get a change of heart. (thinking the woman isn't to blame). So he talks to her and accepts her invitation to come to Texas and meet with her and her siblings.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The story goes, when Ernest left N.Y. he traveled to Texas, remarried, and raised a second family in Texas. Ernest had a wife and several children. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Richard also said that he and his father were in the army during the Second World War. And that they had both participated in the 'Battle of the Bulge Campain'

1 NOTE I don't have very many facts about Pehr's first wife. They were married 22 May 1835. She was from Arbrä, Sweden. And came from a farm called Forneby. She died in November the following year, about 18 months after being married. She could have died from Influenza, or maybe pneumonia, or even child birth. At this time I don't know.

1 NOTE It was told to me that Löfgren was John's wife's maiden name. And that this is the name he took when he married her. Late note... Just found wife's rightful name to be Olsdotter.... So that shoots the madden name in the foot... BUT... Inger (wife) was born in Löfvestad... So I'm thinking that Löfgren was taken not from her last name, but from the town that she came from... OK!
2 CONT 
2 CONT I called one of John's grandchildren. A son of Jennie Sturm, Richard, He informed me that the family story was that John Löfgren became homesick for Sweden. And that John had booked passage back to Sweden and that he had died on the boat to Sweden. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT It seems that John may have used the name John Johnson while he was living in America...
